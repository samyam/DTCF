The executable takes the input form

srun -N p1*p1*p2*p2 run.x p1 p2 Vb N

THe number of nodes must be equal to p1*p1*p2*p2. The grid size is
[p1,p1,p2,p2]. Vb is the number of blocks in each dimension and N
is the size of the tensor in each dimension.

The dgemm call is in localcontract.cc and the library required is
included in localcontract.h. Make edit to these files to include the
required libraries for BGQ and HOPPER.


Parameters to run on

p1 = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

p2 = 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

Vb = 8 16 32 64

N = 128, 256

Run on all possible combinations of these. If the p1*p1*p2*p2 is
too large then obviously cannot run on them so skip those.
